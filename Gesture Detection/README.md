# AI Handpose Estimation

|[Code for Detection](https://github.com/RusticHaze634/OpenCV_Walks/blob/main/Gesture%20Detection/Handpose%20Estimation%201.ipynb)|
## Methodology:
- **S**et up MediaPipe for Python
- **D**etect hands from real time webcam feed
- **E**stimate hand poses using MediaPipe Hands
- **O**utput images with detections using OpenCV

## Hand landmarks detection on an image using Mediapipe

## Industry use cases

- **Smart homes:** One of the more recent applications of computer vision, it's gaining traction in mainstream households because of the benefits it provides to everyday life.
- **Smart TVs:** This scenario, in which the user adjusts settings such as volume and channel with the flick of a finger, is common.
- **Games:** This technology is finding its way into more interactive video games that simulate the real thing.

## Libraries Used:

- **Mediapipe** 
- **OpenCV**
- **Numpy** 
- **uuid**
- **os**

## For Drawing the Hand and Capture video show on the Window:

- Launching hand detection function of Mediapipe as hands
- BGR 2 RGB
- Flip on horizontal
- Set flag
- Detections
- Set flag to true
- RGB 2 BGR
- Detections
- Rendering results
- Show capture video on window
- Save output image shots

## Output :
